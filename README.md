Languager
=========

A simple tool to handle internationalization of source code.
- It extracts keys and default translations out of source files using regexes.
- For each language, it generates a set of translated files where the regexes are replaced with their actual value in a given language.
- It can generate properties files to be used by java.
- It can perform validity checks on the translated values.

See languager-demo module for how it works.
